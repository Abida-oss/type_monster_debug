                    LocalStorage and SessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that- <br>
                    <strong>i.</strong> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB on the other hand The storage
                    capacity of session storage is 5MB. <br>
                    <strong>ii.</strong> As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or
                    manually but session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is
                    stored only for the duration of a session, i.e.,
                    until the browser (or tab) is closed

                    <strong>Global Scope:</strong> A variable declared outside a function, called Global. Variables declared
                    Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a
                    JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a
                    block. <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for
                    or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables
                    declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope. let & const are also called as block
                    scope that is they are accessible within that particular block.

                    How Does an Event Loop Work?

                    An event loop is an event-listener which functions inside the NodeJS environment and is always ready to
                    listen, process,
                    and output for an event. An event can be anything from a mouse click to a keypress or a timeout.
    
                    When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the provided input script which may make
                    async API calls,
                    schedule timers, then begins processing the event loop. In the previous example, the initial input
                    script consisted of
                    console.log() statements and a setTimeout() function which schedules a timer.
    
                    When using Node.js, a special library module called libuv is used to perform async operations. This
                    library is also
                    used, together with the back logic of Node, to manage a special thread pool called the libuv thread
                    pool.This thread
                    pool is composed of four threads used to delegate operations that are too heavy for the event loop. I/O
                    operations,
                    Opening and closing connections, setTimeouts are the example of such operations.
    
                    When the thread pool completes a task, a callback function is called which handles the error(if any) or
                    does some other
                    operation. This callback function is sent to the event queue. When the call stack is empty, the event
                    goes through the
                    event queue and sends the callback to the call stack.
