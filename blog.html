                    i. The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB on the other hand The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. <br>
                    ii. As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually but session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., 
                    until the browser (or tab) is closed

                    <strong>Global Scope:</strong> A variable declared outside a function, called Global. Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope. let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block.
